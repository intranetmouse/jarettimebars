		The jaret timebars package contains a viewer for a data model containing rows of intervals. The viewer displays the
		intervals in a Gantt chart fashion. The viewer is implemented for Swing and the SWT toolkit using a delegate for
		most of the work. <b>Priority of the development is the SWT version! Swing mostly caught up with version 1.30.</b>
		</p>
		<p>If you want to know about new versions you can <b>follow the

		<subsection name="Status and platforms">
		<p>
			The TimeBarViewer is production quality - as long as the supported features serve the purposes
			of the application (In fact it is in production use since Q1/2005). With the 1.0 version the SWT version 
			is stable.
			<b>However: This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY;
			without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The Swing version of the TimeBarViewer should run on every platform supporting Java 1.5. The main testing of the SWT
			component was done on Win32. Tests have also been performed on Linux with the GTK+ version of SWT and on Mac OS X. Due to the
			nature of the SWT toolkit it can not be guaranteed that the component will work on all platforms.
