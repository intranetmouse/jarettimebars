		<section name="status and plans">
			<p>This page contains information about the current state of the distribution and future plans.</p>
			<p>Jaret timebars are developed using java 1.5. The SWT version has a higher priority than
			the swing version. In fact the last changes have not been done for the swing version as you can observe when reading the changelog.
			
			</p>
			<subsection name="Status 1.0">
				<ul>
			<li>
				Development and testing is done using win xp. Mac OSX and Linux (GTK) tested: working, see additional documentation for details.
			</li>
			<li>
				 The viewer for Swing will <b>not</b> catch up with the swt version until after 1.0. 
			</li>
			
				</ul>
			
			</subsection>


			<subsection name="future versions">
				<ul>
			<li>
				possibly support for variable row heights  (since 1.12)
			</li>
			<li>
				check Swing version gets near to the 1.0 SWT (is in fact quite near)
			</li>
			<li>
				check the paperclips library for enhanced print support (checked, nice library, no time)
			</li>

				</ul>
