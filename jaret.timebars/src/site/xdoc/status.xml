			<p>This page contains information about the current state of the distribution and future plans.</p>
			<p>Jaret timebars are developed using Java 1.8 beginning at version 1.50, and used Java 1.5 prior to that.
			The SWT version has a higher priority than the Swing version, although since version 1.30, the Swing version is close to the SWT version.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Status 1.50">
				<ul>
					<li>
						This version is a "friendly fork" by Chris Dailey.
						I made bug fix contributions to previous releases.
						Starting in late 2013, Peter Kliem no longer had time to devote to timebars, so the final batch of bug fixes I submitted were never applied. 
						Therefore, the purpose of this fork is to add those bug fixes and make them available to the world.
						The goal is to make as few breaking changes as possible, though in the first release of the fork, there were some breaking changes:
					</li>
					<li>
						The groupId is being changed to org.intranet.mouse so it is not confused with the original de.jaret groupId.
					</li>
					<li>
						BREAKING CHANGE: Support of larger time periods forced us to change seconds from int to long.
					</li>
					<li>
						BREAKING CHANGE: The minimum supported version has changed from Java 1.5 to Java 1.8.
					</li>
					<li>
						The SWT version is not currently buildable under Maven and Java 1.8, so it is not included.
						The reason is that the support of SWT in Maven Central for Java 1.8 is poor.
						I would like to add support in the future, though this may only be possible if the library is upgraded past Java 1.8.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Status 1.0">
				<ul>
					<li>
						Development and testing is done using win xp. Mac OSX and Linux (GTK) tested: working, see additional documentation for details.
					</li>
					<li>
						The viewer for Swing will <b>not</b> catch up with the swt version until after 1.0. 
					</li>
				</ul>
